# Hi, I'm Caitlin 👋

💡 Recent graduate of the Lighthouse Labs Web Development Bootcamp

🧩 I like puzzles and pretty things, so my passion for building aesthetic and functional web apps comes naturally!

📚 I am currently reading *Grokking Algorithms* by Aditya Y. Bhargava

🪩 I am working on creating my portfolio website, built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com), and [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org). I'm using Figma to plan and design, stay tuned for updates!

🥐 I am always down for a chat over a cup of tea and a pastry, shoot me a message or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/caitlinvandersluis/) if you want to  spend some time being creative together!
