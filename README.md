# Hi, I'm Caitlin 👋

👩‍💻 Software Developer Intern at [Giftbit](https://www.giftbit.com)

💡 Graduate of the Lighthouse Labs Web Development Bootcamp

🧩 I like puzzles and pretty things, so my passion for building aesthetic and functional web apps comes naturally!

📚 I am currently reading *Refactoring UI* by Adam Wathan & Steve Schoger

🥐 I am always down for a chat over a cup of tea and a pastry, shoot me a message or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/caitlinvandersluis/) if you want to  spend some time being creative together!
